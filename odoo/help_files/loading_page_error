odoo javascript Error


1.Error is from Javascript because problem is in loading view and no error windows has been shown
2.Check all addons of the server and pick the all customized module which has javascript related customization/Development
3.There are two options now for tracing.
3a.Remove the custom addons from the server's config file
3b.Comment the xml,javascript file in __openerp__ file of modules which we picked in step 2

Through above steps you can run your server.

Now if server is up, check the modules installed.
