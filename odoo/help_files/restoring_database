It problem with need make update=all manual.

I may reconfigure user odoo on server and make config for debug console.

Now you can: sudo su odoo

You need start in console: /usr/local/src/odoo/openerp-server -c /etc/odoo/odoo-server-d.conf --debug --update=all

After than go to web , select your database or just rafresh page. In console you can check all steps. When in console finish update and web start, Press Ctr-c and start odoo-server normaly.

Now i am has already done and POS works.

For future you need make / sudo service odoo start/stop and it automatically start/stop if server restart.
