#Pushing to a remote

	#Use git push to push your local branch to a remote repository.

	#The git push command takes two arguments:

	#A remote name, for example, origin
	
	#A branch name, for example, master
	
	#For example:

	git push  <REMOTENAME> <BRANCHNAME> 

	#As an example, you usually run "git push origin master" to push your local changes to your online repository.
	
	git push origin master
